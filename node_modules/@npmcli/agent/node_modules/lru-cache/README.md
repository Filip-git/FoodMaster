# lru-cache

A cache object that deletes the least-recently-used items.

Specify a max number of the most recently used items that you
want to keep, and this cache will keep that many of the most
recently accessed items.

This is not primarily a TTL cache, and does not make strong TTL
guarantees. There is no preemptive pruning of expired items by
default, but you _may_ set a TTL on the cache or on a single
`set`. If you do so, it will treat expired items as missing, and
delete them when fetched. If you are more interested in TTL
caching than LRU caching, check out
